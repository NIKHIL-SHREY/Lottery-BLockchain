# Blockchain Lottery Project

This project is a simple implementation of a blockchain-based lottery system using JavaScript for the front end and Solidity for the smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain.

## Overview

The blockchain lottery project aims to provide a transparent and decentralized platform for conducting lotteries. The entire process is managed by a smart contract deployed on the Ethereum blockchain, ensuring fairness and transparency. Players can participate by purchasing tickets using cryptocurrency, and winners are selected randomly through the blockchain.
